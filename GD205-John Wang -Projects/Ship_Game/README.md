  This ship game simulates a single player version of the board game Battleship. The player must make guesses as to where the game places ships and determines if the player hits or misses. The code implements the flyweight, observer, and prototype pattern. The Flyweight pattern allows the game to efficiently handle a large number of cells and ships by sharing common objects and reducing memory usage. The Cell class represents individual cells in the grid, and The Ship class represents different ships used in the game. The CellFactory class ensures that Cell objects are created only when needed and shared among multiple grid positions, hence reducing memory consumption. The ShipFactory class manages the creation and reuse of Ship objects by cloning the prototypes by using the Prototype pattern and sharing them across different game sessions. The Observer pattern is used to notify GameObserver about important game events,  like "Only two ships left!" or "Game Over! All ships have been sunk.".
