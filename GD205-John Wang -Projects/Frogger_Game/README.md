 The fogger project mimics the frog crossing the river by jumping between logs and roads with cars. The frog will die if it falls into the water or is hit by vehicles. The frog will have ten times to repeat.  The code implemented with bufferManager, stateManager, gameLoopmanager and updatemanager.  The bufferManager maintains the current buffer and the next buffer; the current buffer contains the graphics data that is actively displayed on the screen, and the next buffer is used to render new graphics off-screen, ensuring updates happen smoothly. The buffers are swapped using the swapBuffer method, providing a seamless transition between frames. The stateManager is used to rack and manage the state of the game, like menu, playing, and game over. The gameLoopManager controls the flow of the game and ensures that updating and rendering happen in the correct sequence during each frame. The updatemanager manages all game-related update operations like movement collision detection. The code is well organized and decoupled by introducing the above four Managers,.Â
