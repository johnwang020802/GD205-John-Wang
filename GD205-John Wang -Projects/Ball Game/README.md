   Ball Game mimics the Vintage Pachinko game by using a Command pattern. The command pattern is used to control the behavior of adding a ball. The general command interface is declared first, then the Add Ball command implements the interface, which contains the constructor and executes the method. The ball player is declared to add the ball. The CommandInvoker is the general class that manages and executes commands. The client can use both commandInvoker and player to execute the add ball command. By using the command pattern, the code is more modular, and new commands or existing ones can be easily added or modified without impacting other parts of the code.
